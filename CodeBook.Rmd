###run_analysis.R is used to achieve the following tasks:

  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      
      Using the read.table function, training and test data, labels,subjects, and features were defined.
      The data was then merged into a single dataset using the rbind function.
  
  2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      
      The grep function was used to search for mean and standard deviation subsets.

  3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  
      Activity labels were extracted using read.table and associated with new data.

  4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

      A text file (tidydataset.txt) is created using write.file which contains the average of each variable by activity and subject.
